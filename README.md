ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task, I conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis using Python, primarily leveraging Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Key Activities:

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values and duplicates

Standardized column formats

Statistical Summary:

Computed mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles

Examined distributions using histograms and boxplots

Correlation Analysis:

Used heatmaps and scatterplots to explore relationships between numeric features

Identified potential drivers of outcomes and anomalies

Insight Generation:

Segmented data to analyze patterns across different categories

Formulated hypotheses and validated them through data-driven insights

Outcome:
This task strengthened my ability to perform EDA, which is crucial for identifying patterns, detecting outliers, and preparing data for modeling or reporting.
